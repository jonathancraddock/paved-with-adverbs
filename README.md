# Paved With Adverbs

>I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops. To put it another way, they're like dandelions. If you have one on your lawn, it looks pretty and unique. If you fail to root it out, however, you find five the next day... fifty the day after that... and then, my brothers and sisters, your lawn is totally, completely, and profligately covered with dandelions. By then you see them for the weeds they really are, but by then it's—GASP!!—too late.

## What is this?

It's an exception custom dictionary, for use in LibreOffice.

My end goal is to highlight adverb use in a LibreOffice document, in real-time, whilst typing. Adding an *exception* dictionary results in a custom set of words being underlined, as a spelling mistake. It's not ideal, but it's a stepping stone while I think of a better approach.

To build the word list I found half a dozen lists of common adverbs, merged them, and removed duplicates. It's subjective, but I don't accept that a word like "not" is among the evil adverbs and so I removed it, and I'm 50/50 on adverbs such as "always", or "never". And none of the lists I found online included the word "completely"; or "profligately" for that matter. At a mere 1200 words (so far) it is far from comprehensive and it requires revision.

Should I *even* include "even", which can function as an adjective or an adverb, or a verb?

## What's next?

- [ ] I would prefer adverbs to be highlighted using a different colour, to distinguish them from actual spelling errors. There does not appear to be any way to do that with a custom dictionary, perhaps a macro is required, but either way, that's a work in progress.

- [ ] Build and refine a more comprehensive custom dictionary.
